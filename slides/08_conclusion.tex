\section{Thesis Conclusion}
\begin{frame}{}
\begin{itemize}

\item A cross-over approach is promoted, utilising the physical layer for key generation to facilitate upper-layer encryption;
\item Novel methods, such as secrecy splitting and CRicKET, address challenges in keyless and key-based PLS, respectively;
\item Exploiting spatial channel correlation is introduced for authenticating co-located devices, leading to methods CHRYSP and SDF-RFID.    
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Endnote}
  The state-of-the-art in PLS has been furthered, thus providing a viable basis for security enhancement to wireless networks of small devices.
