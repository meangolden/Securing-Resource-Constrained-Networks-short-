\begin{frame}{Limitations of Traditional Ways of Security}
\begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> Rapid 5G adoption increased connected devices, often with memory and energy constraints;
    \item<2-> Traditional security methods (e.g., public key cryptography) are impractical due to resource-intensive calculations;
    \item<3-> Inadequate security mechanisms in low-power/low-memory devices lead to fixed or low entropy keys, posing network vulnerabilities;
    \item<4-> PKC-based authentication fails to protect against person-in-the-middle attacks in short-range communications systems.
\end{itemize}


%\begin{itemize}
 %   \item<1-> The rapid adoption of 5G technology has led to a significant increase in the number of connected devices, many of which have constraints on memory and energy.
    
  %  \item<2-> Traditional security methods, such as public key cryptography (PKC), involve intensive calculations and require excessive resources for low-cost devices, making them impractical.
   % \item<3-> Inadequate security mechanisms for low-power/low-memory devices can result in fixed or low entropy keys, posing vulnerabilities to the entire network.
    %\item<4-> PKC-based authentication does not protect against person-in-the-middle attacks, which are prevalent in short-range communications systems like keyless entry and contactless payments.
 %\end{itemize}

    Physical Layer Security (PLS) encompasses
    \begin{itemize}
        \item keyless PLS;
        \item key-based PLS;
        \item the recent branch of Physical Layer Authentication (PLA).

%\frametitle{PLS as a potential solution}

%\begin{itemize}
%\item<1-> Keyless PLS utilises the inherent randomness of the physical medium to achieve confidentiality without the need for keys or a secure key exchange.
%\item<2->Key-based PLS extracts unique randomness from the physical link to generate shared secret keys for symmetric cryptography.
%\item<3->PLA identifies devices based on hardware imperfections in transmitted signals and offers faster authentication before signal demodulation and decoding.

    
%\end{itemize}
